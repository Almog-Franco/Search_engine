Welcome to my search engine app :mag_right:

# Capabilities 

This search engine has the ability to do the following:

1. Search summaries ‚úçÔ∏è (using Wikipedia's api)

2. Search pictures üì∑  (using pixabay's api)

3 . Search videos üìπ (using youtube's api)

# How to run?

1. Open Terminal/CMD

2. Navigate to the folder where the app is saved

3. Run the following command:

docker-compose up

The app will be availible in the following address : http://localhost:8501

# 3rd component

The app uses Redis cache in order to reduce the amount of API requests sent to the servers.
This can potentially save a lot of money since most of the API's charge for the amount of requests sent.

For this project though, it helps since the app is using free API which allow limited requests per day.
